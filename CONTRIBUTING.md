# How to Contribute

Contributons from the open source community are curcial to the project's success!

## Just some quick notes:
* Github Issues:
  * Before opening an issue, make sure it doesn't already exist.
  * Indicate the current version or branch you are working from.
  * Include the steps to reproduce the error. 
* Pull Requests:
  * Keep commits clean and concise. (Squash them if necessary.)
  * Please tag any relevant issues in your pull requests.
  * Pull requests should be detailed as to what changes were made and why.
  * Make sure to add tests to verify your work.
  * Make sure all tests pass and that you haven't broken any code elsewhere.
  * Document your code inline as well as update the Docs as necessary

## Style and Spacing Conventions
* Javascript (and all other files unless other wise noted/required)
  * SPACES not tabs
  * 2 spaces
  * Sample Code Block
  ```javascript
  /**
   * Explain your Function Here
   */
  var yourFunction = function() {  
    // Functions should be set equal for a variable
    // Opening curley braces should be on the same line as the function decleration
    // semicolons after the closing curley brace!
  };
  ```
## Thanks! :-)
